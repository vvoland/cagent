## [v1.23.0] - 2026-02-12

This release improves TUI display accuracy, enhances API security defaults, and fixes several memory leaks and session handling issues.

## What's New

- Adds optional setup script support for evaluation sessions to prepare container environments before agent execution
- Adds user_prompt tools to the planner for interactive user questions

## Improvements

- Makes session compaction non-blocking with spinner feedback instead of blocking the TUI render thread
- Returns error responses for unknown tool calls instead of silently skipping them
- Strips null values from MCP tool call arguments to fix compatibility with models like GPT-5.2
- Improves error handling and logging in evaluation judge with better error propagation and structured logging

## Bug Fixes

- Fixes incorrect tool count display in TUI when running in --remote mode
- Fixes tick leak that caused ~10% CPU usage when assistant finished answering
- Fixes session store leak and removes redundant session store methods
- Fixes A2A agent card advertising unroutable wildcard address by using localhost
- Fixes potential goroutine leak in monitorStdin
- Fixes Agents.UnmarshalYAML to properly reject unknown fields in agent configurations
- Persists tool call error state in session messages so failed tool calls maintain error status when sessions are reloaded

## Technical Changes

- Removes CORS middleware from 'cagent api' command
- Changes default binding from 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1:8080 for 'cagent api', 'cagent a2a' and 'cagent mcp' commands
