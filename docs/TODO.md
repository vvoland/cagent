# Documentation TODO

## New Pages

- [x] **Go SDK** — Not documented anywhere. The `examples/golibrary/` directory shows how to use cagent as a Go library. Needs a dedicated page. *(Completed: pages/guides/go-sdk.html)*
- [x] **Hooks** — `hooks` agent config (`pre_tool_use`, `post_tool_use`, `session_start`, `session_end`, `on_user_input`) is a significant feature with no documentation page. Covers running shell commands at various agent lifecycle points. *(Completed: pages/configuration/hooks.html)*
- [x] **Permissions** — Top-level `permissions` config with `allow`/`deny` glob patterns for tool call approval. Mentioned briefly in TUI page but has no dedicated reference. *(Completed: pages/configuration/permissions.html)*
- [x] **Sandbox Mode** — Shell tool `sandbox` config runs commands in Docker containers. Includes `image` and `paths` (bind mounts with `:ro` support). Not documented. *(Completed: pages/configuration/sandbox.html)*
- [x] **Structured Output** — Agent-level `structured_output` config (name, description, schema, strict). Forces model responses into a JSON schema. Not documented. *(Completed: pages/configuration/structured-output.html)*
- [x] **Model Routing** — Model-level `routing` config with rules that route requests to different models based on example phrases (rule-based router). *(Completed: pages/configuration/routing.html)*
- [x] **Custom Providers (top-level `providers` section)** — The `providers` top-level config key for defining reusable provider definitions with `api_type`, `base_url`, `token_key`. *(Completed: Added to pages/configuration/overview.html)*
- [x] **LSP Tool** — `type: lsp` toolset that provides Language Server Protocol integration (diagnostics, code actions, references, rename, etc.). Not documented anywhere. *(Completed: pages/tools/lsp.html)*
- [x] **User Prompt Tool** — `type: user_prompt` toolset that allows agents to ask the user for input mid-conversation. Not documented. *(Completed: pages/tools/user-prompt.html)*
- [x] **API Tool** — `api_config` on toolsets for defining HTTP API tools with endpoint, method, headers, args, and output_schema. Not documented. *(Completed: pages/tools/api.html)*
- [ ] **Branching Sessions** — TUI feature (v1.20.6) allowing editing previous messages to create branches. Mentioned in TUI page but could use more detail.
