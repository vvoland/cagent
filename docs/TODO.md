# Documentation TODO

## Installation
- [x] Add Homebrew install instructions for Mac/Linux
- [x] Mention that cagent comes pre-installed with Docker Desktop
- [x] Explain why `task build-local` is recommended on Windows (Docker Buildx cross-compilation)

## Quick Start
- [x] Clarify that Step 1 (install binary) and Step 2 (build from source) are two alternative options, not sequential steps
- [x] Add a path to get started from a built-in example (`cagent run examples/...`) or the default agent
- [x] Show running an agent from the registry (`cagent run agentcatalog/...`)

## Tools
- [x] Add missing built-in tools documentation (think, todo, memory, fetch, script, etc.)
- [x] Expand Tool Config page with more detailed content and examples for each tool type

## Features
- [x] Fix broken TUI demo GIF link on the home page

## Core Concepts
- [x] Move Agent Distribution from Features to Core Concepts (packaging & sharing is a fundamental concept)

## New Pages
- [ ] Remote runtime — remote runtime/server mode is not documented anywhere
- [ ] Changelog / What's New — could add a page or section sourced from `CHANGELOG.md`
