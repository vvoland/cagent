# Usage and configuration

This guide will help you get started with `cagent` and learn how to use its
powerful multi-agent system to accomplish various tasks.

## What is cagent?

`cagent` is a powerful, customizable multi-agent system that orchestrates AI
agents with specialized capabilities and tools. It features:

- **🏗️ Multi-tenant architecture** with client isolation and session management
- **🔧 Rich tool ecosystem** via Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration
- **🤖 Hierarchical agent system** with intelligent task delegation
- **🌐 Multiple interfaces** including CLI, TUI and API server
- **📦 Agent distribution** via Docker registry integration
- **🔒 Security-first design** with proper client scoping and resource isolation
- **⚡ Event-driven streaming** for real-time interactions
- **🧠 Multi-model support** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), [Docker Model Runner (DMR)](https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/))


## Why?

After passing the last year+ building AI agents of various types, using a variety of software solutions and frameworks, we kept asking ourselves some of the same questions:

- How can we make building and running useful agentic systems less of a hassle?
- Most agents we build end up using many of the same building blocks. Can we re-use most of those building block and have declarative configurations for new agents?
- How can we package and share agents amongst each other as simply as possible without all the headaches?

We really think we're getting somewhere as we build out the primitives of `cagent` so, in keeping with our love for open-source software in general, we decided to **share it and build it in the open** to allow the community at large to make use of our work and contribute to the future of the project itself. 

## Running Agents

### Command Line Interface

cagent provides multiple interfaces and deployment modes:

```bash
# Terminal UI (TUI)
$ cagent run config.yaml
$ cagent run config.yaml -a agent_name    # Run a specific agent
$ cagent run config.yaml --debug          # Enable debug logging
$ cagent run config.yaml --yolo           # Auto-accept all the tool calls
$ cagent run config.yaml "First message"  # Start the conversation with the agent with a first message
$ cagent run config.yaml -c df            # Run with a named command from YAML

# Model Override Examples
$ cagent run config.yaml --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0    # Override all agents to use Claude
$ cagent run config.yaml --model "agent1=openai/gpt-4o"         # Override specific agent
$ cagent run config.yaml --model "agent1=openai/gpt-4o,agent2=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0"  # Multiple overrides

# One off without TUI
$ cagent exec config.yaml                 # Run the agent once, with default instructions
$ cagent exec config.yaml "First message" # Run the agent once with instructions
$ cagent exec config.yaml --yolo          # Run the agent once and auto-accept all the tool calls

# API Server (HTTP REST API)
$ cagent api config.yaml
$ cagent api config.yaml --listen :8080
$ cagent api ociReference # start API from oci reference 
## start API from oci reference, auto-pull every 10 mins and reload if a new team was pulled
$ cagent api ociReference --pull-interval 10

# ACP Server (Agent Client Protocol via stdio)
$ cagent acp config.yaml                 # Start ACP server on stdio

# Other commands
$ cagent new                          # Initialize new project
$ cagent new --model openai/gpt-5-mini --max-tokens 32000  # Override max tokens during generation
$ cagent eval config.yaml             # Run evaluations
$ cagent pull docker.io/user/agent    # Pull agent from registry
$ cagent push docker.io/user/agent    # Push agent to registry
```

#### Default agent

cagent handles a special case for a **default** agent. Running `cagent run` or `cagent run default`
will quickly open the TUI on a default, basic agent. This agent is capable and has a few tools
but is not a replacement for a more specialized agent. It's here for when you don't think you need
a special agent.

#### Aliases

When using the same agent over and over again, from different working directories, it can be cumbersome
to run `cagent run /full/path/to/the/agent`.

That's where `aliases` come in handy. You can define has many short aliases as you want to full
agent file paths of names.

```bash
cagent alias ls           # List the aliases

cagent alias add pirate /full/path/to/the/pirate.yaml
cagent run pirate

cagent alias add other ociReference
cagent run other
```

It's even possible to replace the `default` agent with `aliases`:

```bash
cagent alias add default /full/path/to/the/pirate.yaml
cagent run                # Runs the pirate.yaml agent
```

**Alias Options:**

You can configure aliases with runtime options that are automatically applied when the alias is used:

```bash
# Create an alias that always runs in yolo mode (auto-approve tool calls)
cagent alias add yolo-coder agentcatalog/coder --yolo

# Create an alias with a specific model override
cagent alias add fast-coder agentcatalog/coder --model openai/gpt-4o-mini

# Create an alias with both options
cagent alias add turbo agentcatalog/coder --yolo --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0
```

When listing aliases, options are displayed in brackets:

```bash
$ cagent alias ls
Registered aliases (3):

  fast-coder  → agentcatalog/coder [model=openai/gpt-4o-mini]
  turbo       → agentcatalog/coder [yolo, model=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0]
  yolo-coder  → agentcatalog/coder [yolo]

Run an alias with: cagent run <alias>
```

**Note:** Command-line flags override alias options. For example, `cagent run yolo-coder --yolo=false` will run the alias without yolo mode.

### Interface-Specific Features

#### File Attachments

In the TUI, you can attach file contents to your message using the `@` trigger:

1. Type `@` to open the file completion menu
2. Start typing to filter files (respects `.gitignore`)
3. Select a file to insert the reference (e.g., `@src/main.go`)
4. When you send your message, the file contents are automatically expanded and attached at the end of your message, while `@somefile.txt` references stay in your message so the LLM can reference the file contents in the context of your question

**Example:**
```
Explain what the code in @pkg/agent/agent.go does
```

The agent gets the full file contents and places them in a structured `<attachments>`
block at the end of the message, while the UI doesn't display full file contents.

#### TUI Interactive Commands

During TUI sessions, you can use special slash commands. Type `/` to see all available commands or use the command palette (Ctrl+K):

| Command     | Description                                                         |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/attach`   | Attach a file to your message (usage: /attach [path])               |
| `/compact`  | Summarize the current conversation (usage: /compact [instructions]) |
| `/copy`     | Copy the current conversation to the clipboard                      |
| `/cost`     | Show detailed cost breakdown for this session                       |
| `/eval`     | Create an evaluation report (usage: /eval [filename])               |
| `/exit`     | Exit the application                                                |
| `/export`   | Export the session as HTML (usage: /export [filename])              |
| `/model`    | Change the model for the current agent (see [Model Switching](#runtime-model-switching)) |
| `/new`      | Start a new conversation                                            |
| `/sessions` | Browse and load past sessions                                       |
| `/shell`    | Start a shell                                                       |
| `/star`     | Toggle star on current session                                      |
| `/theme`    | Change the color theme (see [Theming](#theming))                    |
| `/think`    | Toggle thinking/reasoning mode                                      |
| `/title`    | Set or regenerate session title (usage: /title [new title])         |
| `/yolo`     | Toggle automatic approval of tool calls                             |

#### Runtime Model Switching

The `/model` command (or `ctrl+m`) allows you to change the AI model used by the current agent during a session. This is useful when you want to:

- Switch to a more capable model for complex tasks
- Use a faster/cheaper model for simple queries
- Test different models without modifying your YAML configuration

**How it works:**

1. Type `/model`, `Ctrl+M` or use the command palette (`Ctrl+K`) and select "Model"
2. A picker dialog opens showing:
   - **Config models**: All models defined in your YAML configuration, with the agent's default model marked as "(default)"
   - **Custom input**: Type any model in `provider/model` format  
   (e.g., `openai/gpt-5`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0`)  
   Alloy models are supported with comma separated definitions (e.g. `provider1/model1,provider2/model2,...`)
3. Select a model or type a custom one and press Enter

**Persistence:** Your model choice is saved with the session. When you reload a past session using `/sessions`, the model you selected will automatically be restored.

To revert to the agent's default model, select the model marked with "(default)" in the picker.

#### Theming

The TUI supports customizable color themes. You can create and use custom themes to personalize the appearance of the terminal interface.

**Theme Configuration:**

Your theme preference is saved globally in `~/.config/cagent/config.yaml` under `settings.theme`. If not set, the built-in default theme is used.

**Creating Custom Themes:**

Create theme files in `~/.cagent/themes/` as YAML files (`.yaml` or `.yml`). Theme files are **partial overrides** — you only need to specify the colors you want to change. Any omitted keys fall back to the built-in default theme values.

```yaml
# ~/.cagent/themes/my-theme.yaml
name: "My Custom Theme"

colors:
  # Backgrounds
  background: "#1a1a2e"
  background_alt: "#16213e"
  
  # Text colors
  text_bright: "#ffffff"
  text_primary: "#e8e8e8"
  text_secondary: "#b0b0b0"
  text_muted: "#707070"
  
  # Accent colors
  accent: "#4fc3f7"
  brand: "#1d96f3"
  
  # Status colors
  success: "#4caf50"
  error: "#f44336"
  warning: "#ff9800"
  info: "#00bcd4"

# Optional: Customize syntax highlighting colors
chroma:
  comment: "#6a9955"
  keyword: "#569cd6"
  literal_string: "#ce9178"

# Optional: Customize markdown rendering colors
markdown:
  heading: "#4fc3f7"
  link: "#569cd6"
  code: "#ce9178"
```

**Applying Themes:**

- **In user config** (`~/.config/cagent/config.yaml`):
  ```yaml
  settings:
    theme: my-theme  # References ~/.cagent/themes/my-theme.yaml
  ```

- **At runtime**: Use the `/theme` command to open the theme picker and select from available themes. Your selection is automatically saved to user config and persists across sessions.

**Hot Reload:** Custom theme files are automatically watched for changes. When you edit a user theme file (in `~/.cagent/themes/`), the changes are applied immediately without needing to restart cagent or re-select the theme. This makes it easy to customize themes while seeing changes in real-time.


> **Note:** All user themes are partial overrides applied on top of the `default` theme. If you want to customize a built-in theme, copy the full YAML from the [built-in themes on GitHub](https://github.com/docker/cagent/tree/main/pkg/tui/styles/themes) into `~/.cagent/themes/` and edit the copy. Otherwise, omitted values will use `default` colors, not the original theme's colors.

**Built-in Themes:**

The following themes are included:
- `default` — The built-in default theme with a dark color scheme
- `catppuccin-latte`, `catppuccin-mocha` — Catppuccin themes (light and dark)
- `dracula` — Dracula dark theme
- `gruvbox-dark`, `gruvbox-light` — Gruvbox themes
- `nord` — Nord dark theme
- `one-dark` — One Dark theme
- `solarized-dark` — Solarized dark theme
- `tokyo-night` — Tokyo Night dark theme

**Available Color Keys:**

Themes can customize colors in three sections: `colors`, `chroma` (syntax highlighting), and `markdown` (markdown rendering).

See the [built-in themes on GitHub](https://github.com/docker/cagent/tree/main/pkg/tui/styles/themes) for complete examples.

#### Session Title Editing

You can customize session titles to make them more meaningful and easier to find later. By default, cagent automatically generates titles based on your first message, but you can override or regenerate them at any time.

**Using the `/title` command:**

```
/title                     # Regenerate title using AI (based on at most the last 2 user messages)
/title My Custom Title     # Set a specific title
```

**Using the sidebar:**

In the TUI, you can click on the pencil icon (✎) next to the session title in the sidebar to edit it inline:

1. Click the pencil icon next to the title
2. Type your new title
3. Press Enter to save, or Escape to cancel

**Notes:**
- Manually set titles are preserved and won't be overwritten by auto-generation
- Title changes are persisted immediately to the session
- Works with both local and remote runtimes

    parallel_tool_calls: boolean
    thinking_budget: string|integer # OpenAI: effort level string; Anthropic/Google: integer token budget
```

### Reasoning Effort (thinking_budget)

Determine how much the model should think by setting the `thinking_budget`

- **Disable thinking**: Use `none` (string) or `0` (integer) to explicitly disable thinking for any provider
- **OpenAI**: use effort levels — `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`. Default: `medium`
- **Anthropic**: set an integer token budget. Range is 1024–32768; must be strictly less than `max_tokens`. Default: `8192` with `interleaved_thinking: true`
- **Google (Gemini 2.5)**: set an integer token budget. `0` -> disable thinking, `-1` -> dynamic thinking (model decides). Default: `-1` (dynamic)
- **Google (Gemini 3)**: use effort levels — `minimal` (Flash only), `low`, `medium`, `high`. Default: `high` for Pro, `medium` for Flash
- **Amazon Bedrock (Claude models)**: set an integer token budget, same as Anthropic. Default: `8192` with `interleaved_thinking: true`

**Disabling thinking:**

```yaml
models:
  # Using string "none"
  gpt-no-thinking:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-5
    thinking_budget: none # or 0

  # Using integer 0
  claude-no-thinking:
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-5
    thinking_budget: 0 # or none
```

Note: When thinking is disabled via config, it can still be enabled during a session using the `/think` command, which will restore the provider's default thinking configuration.

Examples (OpenAI):

```yaml
models:
  gpt:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-5-mini
    thinking_budget: low

agents:
  root:
    model: gpt
    instruction: you are a helpful assistant
```

Examples (Anthropic):

```yaml
models:
  claude:
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
    thinking_budget: 1024

agents:
  root:
    model: claude
    instruction: you are a helpful assistant that doesn't think very much
```

Examples (Google Gemini 2.5 - token-based):

```yaml
models:
  gemini-no-thinking:
    provider: google
    model: gemini-2.5-flash
    thinking_budget: 0  # Disable thinking

  gemini-dynamic:
    provider: google
    model: gemini-2.5-flash
    thinking_budget: -1  # Dynamic thinking (model decides) - this is the default

  gemini-fixed:
    provider: google
    model: gemini-2.5-flash
    thinking_budget: 8192  # Fixed token budget

agents:
  root:
    model: gemini-fixed
    instruction: you are a helpful assistant
```

Examples (Google Gemini 3 - level-based):

```yaml
models:
  # Gemini 3 Pro: supports "low" and "high" levels
  gemini-3-pro-high:
    provider: google
    model: gemini-3-pro
    thinking_budget: high  # Default for Pro models

  gemini-3-pro-low:
    provider: google
    model: gemini-3-pro
    thinking_budget: low

  # Gemini 3 Flash: supports "minimal", "low", "medium", "high" levels
  gemini-3-flash-medium:
    provider: google
    model: gemini-3-flash
    thinking_budget: medium  # Default for Flash models

  gemini-3-flash-minimal:
    provider: google
    model: gemini-3-flash
    thinking_budget: minimal

agents:
  root:
    model: gemini-3-pro-high
    instruction: you are a helpful assistant
```

Examples (Amazon Bedrock Claude):

```yaml
models:
  bedrock-claude:
    provider: amazon-bedrock
    model: global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0
    # thinking_budget defaults to 8192 and interleaved_thinking defaults to true for Claude models
    provider_opts:
      region: us-east-1

  bedrock-claude-custom:
    provider: amazon-bedrock
    model: anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0
    thinking_budget: 16384  # Override default
    provider_opts:
      region: eu-west-1
      interleaved_thinking: true

agents:
  root:
    model: bedrock-claude
    instruction: you are a helpful assistant
```

#### Interleaved Thinking (Anthropic and Bedrock Claude)

Anthropic's interleaved thinking feature uses the Beta Messages API to provide tool calling during model reasoning. This is now enabled by default for both `anthropic` and `amazon-bedrock` (Claude models) providers. You can control this behavior using the `interleaved_thinking` provider option:

```yaml
models:
  claude:
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
    # thinking_budget defaults to 8192
    # interleaved_thinking defaults to true
    provider_opts:
      interleaved_thinking: false  # Disable if needed

  bedrock-claude:
    provider: amazon-bedrock
    model: global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0
    # thinking_budget defaults to 8192 for Claude models
    # interleaved_thinking defaults to true for Claude models
    provider_opts:
      region: us-east-1
      interleaved_thinking: false  # Disable if needed
```

Notes:

- **OpenAI**: If an invalid effort value is set, the request will fail with a clear error. Default: `medium`
- **Anthropic**: Values < 1024 or ≥ `max_tokens` are ignored (warning logged). Default: `thinking_budget: 8192` with `interleaved_thinking: true`
- **Amazon Bedrock (Claude)**: Same behavior as Anthropic. Non-Claude Bedrock models are not affected by defaults
- **Google (Gemini 2.5)**: 
  - Most models support values between -1 and 24576 tokens. Set to `0` to disable, `-1` for dynamic thinking
  - Gemini 2.5 Pro: supports 128–32768 tokens. Cannot be disabled (minimum 128)
  - Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite: supports 512–24576 tokens. Set to `0` to disable, `-1` for dynamic thinking
  - Default: `-1` (dynamic thinking)
- **Google (Gemini 3)**:
  - Uses effort levels instead of token budgets: `minimal` (Flash only), `low`, `medium`, `high`
  - Gemini 3 Pro default: `high`
  - Gemini 3 Flash default: `medium`
- For unsupported providers, `thinking_budget` has no effect
- Debug logs include the applied effort (e.g., "OpenAI request using thinking_budget", "Gemini request using thinking_budget")

See `examples/thinking_budget.yaml` for a complete runnable demo.

#### AWS Bedrock provider usage

**Prerequisites:**
- AWS account with Bedrock enabled in your region
- Model access granted in the [Bedrock Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) (some models require approval)
- AWS credentials configured (see authentication below)

**Authentication:**

Bedrock supports two authentication methods:

**Option 1: Bedrock API key** (simplest)

Set the `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` environment variable with your Bedrock API key. You can customize the env var name using `token_key`:

```yaml
models:
  claude-bedrock:
    provider: amazon-bedrock
    model: global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0
    token_key: AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK  # Name of env var containing your token (default)
    provider_opts:
      region: us-east-1
```

Generate API keys in the [Bedrock Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) under "API keys".

**Option 2: AWS credentials** (default)

Uses the [AWS SDK default credential chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html#specifying-credentials):

1. Environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
2. Shared credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`)
3. Shared config file (`~/.aws/config` with `AWS_PROFILE`)
4. IAM instance roles (EC2, ECS, Lambda)

You can also use `provider_opts.role_arn` for cross-account role assumption.

**Basic usage with AWS profile:**

```yaml
models:
  claude-bedrock:
    provider: amazon-bedrock
    model: global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0
    max_tokens: 64000
    provider_opts:
      profile: my-aws-profile
      region: us-east-1
```

**With IAM role assumption:**

```yaml
models:
  claude-bedrock:
    provider: amazon-bedrock
    model: anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0
    provider_opts:
      role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/BedrockAccessRole"
      external_id: "my-external-id"
```

**provider_opts for Bedrock:**

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `region` | string | AWS region | us-east-1 |
| `profile` | string | AWS profile name | (default chain) |
| `role_arn` | string | IAM role ARN for assume role | (none) |
| `role_session_name` | string | Session name for assumed role | cagent-bedrock-session |
| `external_id` | string | External ID for role assumption | (none) |
| `endpoint_url` | string | Custom endpoint (VPC/testing) | (none) |
| `interleaved_thinking` | bool | Enable reasoning during tool calls (requires thinking_budget) | false |
| `disable_prompt_caching` | bool | Disable automatic prompt caching | false |

#### Prompt Caching (Bedrock)

Prompt caching is automatically enabled for models that support it (detected via models.dev) to reduce latency and costs. System prompts, tool definitions, and recent messages are cached with a 5-minute TTL.

To disable:

```yaml
provider_opts:
  disable_prompt_caching: true
```

**Supported models (via Converse API):**

All Bedrock models that support the Converse API work with cagent. Use inference profile IDs for best availability:

- **Anthropic Claude**: `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0`, `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`
- **Amazon Nova**: `global.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`
- **Meta Llama**: `us.meta.llama3-2-90b-instruct-v1:0`
- **Mistral**: `us.mistral.mistral-large-2407-v1:0`

**Inference profile prefixes:**

| Prefix | Routes to |
|--------|-----------|
| `global.` | All commercial AWS regions (recommended) |
| `us.` | US regions only |
| `eu.` | EU regions only (GDPR compliance) |

```yaml
models:
  claude-global:
    provider: amazon-bedrock
    model: global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0  # Routes to any available region
```

#### DMR (Docker Model Runner) provider usage

If `base_url` is omitted, Docker `cagent` will use `http://localhost:12434/engines/llama.cpp/v1` by default

You can pass DMR runtime (e.g. llama.cpp) options using  
```
models:
  provider: dmr
  provider_opts: 
    runtime_flags: 
```  
The context length is taken from `max_tokens` at the model level:

```yaml
models:
  local-qwen:
    provider: dmr
    model: ai/qwen3
    max_tokens: 8192
    # base_url: omitted -> auto-discovery via Docker Model plugin
    provider_opts:
      runtime_flags: ["--ngl=33", "--top-p=0.9"]
```

`runtime_flags` also accepts a single string with comma or space separation:

```yaml
models:
  local-qwen:
    provider: dmr
    model: ai/qwen3
    max_tokens: 8192
    provider_opts:
      runtime_flags: "--ngl=33 --top-p=0.9"
```

Explicit `base_url` example with multiline runtime_flags string:

```yaml
models:
  local-qwen:
    provider: dmr
    model: ai/qwen3
    base_url: http://127.0.0.1:12434/engines/llama.cpp/v1
    provider_opts:
      runtime_flags: |
        --ngl=33
        --top-p=0.9
```

Requirements and notes:

- Docker Model plugin must be available for auto-configure/auto-discovery
  - Verify with: `docker model status --json`
- Configuration is best-effort; failures fall back to the default base URL
- `provider_opts` currently apply to `dmr`, `anthropic`, and `amazon-bedrock` providers
- `runtime_flags` are passed after `--` to the inference runtime (e.g., llama.cpp)

Parameter mapping and precedence (DMR):

- `ModelConfig` fields are translated into engine-specific runtime flags. For e.g. with the `llama.cpp` backend:
  - `temperature` → `--temp`
  - `top_p` → `--top-p`
  - `frequency_penalty` → `--frequency-penalty`
  - `presence_penalty` → `--presence-penalty`
  ...
- `provider_opts.runtime_flags` always take priority over derived flags on conflict. When a conflict is detected,
Docker `cagent` logs a warning indicating the overridden flag. `max_tokens` is the only exception for now

Examples:

```yaml
models:
  local-qwen:
    provider: dmr
    model: ai/qwen3
    temperature: 0.5            # derives --temp 0.5
    top_p: 0.9                  # derives --top-p 0.9
    max_tokens: 8192            # sets --context-size=8192
    provider_opts:
      runtime_flags: ["--temp", "0.7", "--threads", "8"]  # overrides derived --temp, sets --threads
```

```yaml
models:
  local-qwen:
    provider: dmr
    model: ai/qwen3
    provider_opts:
      runtime_flags: "--ngl=33 --repeat-penalty=1.2"  # string accepted as well
```

##### Speculative Decoding

DMR supports speculative decoding for faster inference by using a smaller draft model to predict tokens ahead. Configure speculative decoding using `provider_opts`:

```yaml
models:
  qwen-with-speculative:
    provider: dmr
    model: ai/qwen3:14B
    max_tokens: 8192
    provider_opts:
      speculative_draft_model: ai/qwen3:0.6B-F16     # Draft model for predictions
      speculative_num_tokens: 16                # Number of tokens to generate speculatively
      speculative_acceptance_rate: 0.8         # Acceptance rate threshold
```

All three speculative decoding options are sent to Model Runner via its internal `POST /engines/_configure` API endpoint:
- `speculative_draft_model` → `speculative.draft_model`
- `speculative_num_tokens` → `speculative.num_tokens`
- `speculative_acceptance_rate` → `speculative.min_acceptance_rate`

These options work alongside `max_tokens` (which sets `context-size`) and `runtime_flags`.

##### Troubleshooting:

- Plugin not found: Docker `cagent` will log a debug message and use the default base URL
- Endpoint empty in status: ensure the Model Runner is running, or set `base_url` manually
- Flag parsing: if using a single string, quote properly in YAML; you can also use a list


### Alloy models

"Alloy models" essentially means using more than one model in the same chat context. Not at the same time, but "randomly" throughout the conversation to try to take advantage of the strong points of each model.

More information on the idea can be found [here](https://xbow.com/blog/alloy-agents)

To have an agent use an alloy model, you can define more than one model in the `model` field, separated by commas.

Example:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0,openai/gpt-5-mini
    ...
```

### Tool Configuration

### Available MCP Tools

Common MCP tools include:

- **Filesystem**: Read/write files
- **Shell**: Execute shell commands
- **Database**: Query databases
- **Web**: Make HTTP requests
- **Git**: Version control operations
- **Browser**: Web browsing and automation
- **Code**: Programming language specific tools
- **API**: REST API integration tools

### Configuring MCP Tools

**Local (stdio) MCP Server:**

```yaml

toolsets:
  - type: mcp # Model Context Protocol
    command: string # Command to execute
    args: [] # Command arguments
    tools: [] # Optional: List of specific tools to enable
    env: [] # Environment variables for this tool
    env_file: [] # Environment variable files
```

Example:

``` yaml
toolsets:
  - type: mcp
    command: rust-mcp-filesystem
    args: ["--allow-write", "."]
    tools: ["read_file", "write_file"] # Optional: specific tools only
    env:
      - "RUST_LOG=debug"
```

**Remote (SSE) MCP Server:**

```yaml
toolsets:
  - type: mcp # Model Context Protocol
    remote:
      url: string # Base URL to connect to
      transport_type: string # Type of MCP transport (sse or streamable)
      headers:
        key: value # HTTP headers. Mainly used for auth
    tools: [] # Optional: List of specific tools to enable
```

Example:

```yaml
toolsets:
  - type: mcp
    remote:
      url: "https://mcp-server.example.com"
      transport_type: "sse"
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer your-token-here"
    tools: ["search_web", "fetch_url"]
```

### Using tools via the Docker MCP Gateway

We recommend running containerized MCP tools, for security and resource isolation.
Under the hood, `cagent` will run them with the [Docker MCP Gateway](https://github.com/docker/mcp-gateway)
so that all the tools in the `Docker MCP Catalog` can be accessed through a single endpoint.

In this example, lets configure `duckduckgo` to give our agents the ability to search the web:

```yaml
toolsets:
  - type: mcp
    ref: docker:duckduckgo
```

### Installing MCP Tools

Example installation of local tools with `npm`:

```bash
# Install Rust-based MCP filesystem tool
npm i -g @rustmcp/rust-mcp-filesystem@latest

# Install other popular MCP tools
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-git
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-web
```

## Built-in Tools

Included in `cagent` are a series of built-in tools that can greatly enhance the capabilities of your agents without needing to configure any external MCP tools.  

**Configuration example**

```yaml
toolsets:
  - type: filesystem # Grants the agent filesystem access
  - type: think # Enables the think tool
  - type: todo # Enable the todo list tool
    shared: boolean # Should the todo list be shared between agents (optional)
  - type: memory # Allows the agent to store memories to a local sqlite db
    path: ./mem.db # Path to the sqlite database for memory storage (optional)
```

Let's go into a bit more detail about the built-in tools that agents can use:

### Think Tool

The think tool allows agents to reason through problems step by step:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    # ... other config
    toolsets:
      - type: think
```

### Todo Tool

The todo tool helps agents manage task lists:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    # ... other config
    toolsets:
      - type: todo
```

### Memory Tool

The memory tool provides persistent storage:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    # ... other config
    toolsets:
      - type: memory
        path: "./agent_memory.db"
```

### Task Transfer Tool

All agents automatically have access to the task transfer tool, which allows
them to delegate tasks to other agents:

```
transfer_task(agent="developer", task="Create a login form", expected_output="HTML and CSS code")
```

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Give your agents access to document knowledge bases using cagent's modular RAG system. It supports:
- Background indexing of files;
- Re-indexing on file changes;
- Using one or more retrieval strategies that can be used individually or combined for hybrid search.

### RAG Configuration

Configure RAG sources at the top level of your config, then reference them in agents:

```yaml
rag:
  my_docs:
    description: "Technical documentation knowledge base"
    docs: [./documents, ./some-doc.md]
    strategies:
      - type: chunked-embeddings
        model: openai/text-embedding-3-small
        database: ./docs.db
        vector_dimensions: 1536

agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: |
      You are an assistant with access to an internal knowledge base.
      Use the knowledge base to gather context before answering user questions
    rag: [my_docs]  # Reference the RAG source
```

### Retrieval Strategies

#### Chunked-Embeddings Strategy (Semantic Search)

Uses embedding models for semantic similarity:

```yaml
rag:
  semantic_search:
    docs: [./knowledge_base]
    strategies:
      - type: chunked-embeddings
        model: openai/text-embedding-3-small
        database: ./vector.db
        vector_dimensions: 1536
        similarity_metric: cosine_similarity
        threshold: 0.5
        limit: 10
        batch_size: 50
        max_embedding_concurrency: 3
        chunking:
          size: 1000
          overlap: 100
```

**Best for:** Understanding intent, synonyms, paraphrasing, multilingual queries

#### Semantic-Embeddings Strategy (LLM-Enhanced Semantic Search)

Uses an LLM to generate semantic summaries of each chunk before embedding, capturing meaning and intent rather than raw text:

```yaml
rag:
  code_search:
    docs: [./src, ./pkg]
    strategies:
      - type: semantic-embeddings
        embedding_model: openai/text-embedding-3-small
        vector_dimensions: 1536
        chat_model: openai/gpt-4o-mini        # LLM for generating summaries
        database: ./semantic.db
        threshold: 0.3
        limit: 10
        ast_context: true                     # Include AST metadata in prompts
        chunking:
          size: 1000
          code_aware: true                    # AST-aware chunking for best results
```

**Best for:** Code search, understanding intent, finding implementations by what they do rather than exact names

**Trade-offs:** Higher quality retrieval but slower indexing (LLM call per chunk) and additional API costs

**Parameters:**
- `embedding_model` (required): Embedding model for vector similarity
- `chat_model` (required): Chat model to generate semantic summaries
- `vector_dimensions` (required): Embedding vector dimensions
- `semantic_prompt`: Custom prompt template (uses `${path}`, `${content}`, `${ast_context}` placeholders)
- `ast_context`: Include TreeSitter AST metadata in prompts (default: `false`)

#### BM25 Strategy (Keyword Search)

Uses traditional keyword matching:

```yaml
rag:
  keyword_search:
    docs: [./knowledge_base]
    strategies:
      - type: bm25
        database: ./bm25.db
        k1: 1.5                    # Term frequency saturation
        b: 0.75                    # Length normalization
        threshold: 0.3             # Minimum BM25 score
        limit: 10
        chunking:
          size: 1000
          overlap: 100
```

**Best for:** Exact terms, technical jargon, proper nouns, code

### Hybrid Retrieval

Combine multiple strategies for best results:

```yaml
rag:
  hybrid_search:
    docs: [./shared_docs]           # Documents indexed by all strategies
    
    strategies:
      - type: chunked-embeddings
        model: embedder
        docs: [./docs]                # Additional chunked-embeddings-specific docs
        database: ./vector.db
        threshold: 0.5
        limit: 20                     # Retrieve 20 candidates
        chunking: {size: 1000, overlap: 100}
      
      - type: bm25
        docs: [./code]                # Additional BM25-specific docs
        database: ./bm25.db
        k1: 1.5
        b: 0.75
        threshold: 0.3
        limit: 15                     # Retrieve 15 candidates
        chunking: {size: 1000, overlap: 100}
    
    results:
      fusion:
        strategy: rrf               # Reciprocal Rank Fusion
        k: 60
      deduplicate: true
      limit: 5                      # Final top 5 results

agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    rag: [hybrid_search]
```

**Features:**
- **Parallel execution**: Strategies run concurrently (total time = max, not sum)
- **Per-strategy docs**: Different content for different strategies
- **Multi-level limits**: Strategy limits control fusion input, final limit controls output
- **Automatic fusion**: Combines results intelligently

### Fusion Strategies

When using multiple retrieval strategies, choose how to combine results:

#### Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) - Recommended

```yaml
results:
  fusion:
    strategy: rrf
    k: 60  # Smoothing parameter (higher = more uniform ranking)
```

**Best for:** Combining different retrieval methods. Rank-based, doesn't require score normalization.

#### Weighted Fusion

```yaml
results:
  fusion:
    strategy: weighted
    weights:
      chunked-embeddings: 0.7
      bm25: 0.3
```

**Best for:** When you know which strategy performs better for your use case.

#### Max Score Fusion

```yaml
results:
  fusion:
    strategy: max
```

**Best for:** Strategies using the same scoring scale. Takes maximum score.

### Result Reranking

Reranking re-scores retrieved documents using a specialized model to improve relevance. This is applied **after** retrieval and fusion, but **before** the final limit.

#### Why Rerank?

Initial retrieval strategies (embeddings, BM25) are fast but approximate. Reranking uses a more sophisticated model to:
- Improve relevance scoring accuracy
- Apply domain-specific criteria
- Consider document metadata (source, recency, type)
- Filter low-quality results

#### Provider Support

| Provider   | Implementation                          | Recommended Use Case         |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| DMR        | Native `/rerank` endpoint               | Production (fast, efficient) |
| OpenAI     | Chat completion + structured outputs    | Flexible, criteria-based     |
| Anthropic  | Beta API + structured outputs           | Complex relevance rules      |
| Gemini     | Structured outputs                      | Cost-effective scoring       |

#### Basic Reranking Configuration

```yaml
rag:
  docs_with_reranking:
    docs: [./knowledge_base]
    strategies:
      - type: chunked-embeddings
        model: openai/text-embedding-3-small
        limit: 20  # Retrieve more candidates for reranking
    
    results:
      reranking:
        model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
      limit: 5  # Final results after reranking
```

#### Advanced Reranking Configuration

```yaml
rag:
  advanced_reranking:
    docs: [./documents]
    strategies:
      - type: chunked-embeddings
        model: embedder
        limit: 20
    
    results:
      reranking:
        model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
        
        # top_k: Only rerank top K results (optional)
        # Useful for cost optimization when retrieving many documents
        # Set to 0 or omit to rerank all results
        top_k: 10
        
        # threshold: Minimum relevance score (0.0-1.0) after reranking (default: 0.5)
        # Results below threshold are filtered out
        # Applied before final limit
        threshold: 0.3
        
        # criteria: Domain-specific relevance guidance (optional)
        # The model receives metadata: source path, chunk index, created_at
        # Use this to guide scoring based on source, recency, or content type
        criteria: |
          When scoring relevance, prioritize:
          - Content from official documentation over blog posts
          - Recent information (check created_at dates)
          - Practical examples and implementation details
          - Documents from docs/ directory when available
      
      deduplicate: true
      limit: 5
```

#### DMR Native Reranking

DMR offers a native reranking endpoint:

```yaml
models:

#### Reranking Model Configuration

Configure sampling parameters for deterministic or creative scoring. Note that temperature defaults to 0.0 for reranking when not explicitly set:

```yaml
models:
  # Deterministic reranking (default behavior)
  openai-rerank:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o-mini
    # temperature: 0.0  # Default for reranking (explicit setting optional)
    max_tokens: 16384
  
  # Anthropic with structured outputs
  claude-rerank:
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-5 # model needs to support structured outputs
    # temperature: 0.0  # Default for reranking
    max_tokens: 16384
  
  # Gemini reranking
  gemini-rerank:
    provider: google
    model: gemini-2.5-flash
    # temperature: 0.0  # Default for reranking
    max_tokens: 16384
```

#### Reranking Configuration Reference

| Field        | Type    | Description                                                           | Default |
|--------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `model`      | string  | Model reference for reranking                                         | -       |
| `top_k`      | int     | Only rerank top K results (0 = rerank all)                            | 0       |
| `threshold`  | float   | Minimum score (0.0-1.0) after reranking                               | 0.5     |
| `criteria`   | string  | Domain-specific relevance guidance (not supported by DMR native)      | ""      |

**Notes:**
- Reranking adds latency but significantly improves result quality
- Use `top_k` to trade quality for speed and cost
- Temperature defaults to 0.0 for deterministic scoring when not explicitly set (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
- Default threshold of 0.5 filters documents with negative logits (sigmoid < 0.5 = not relevant)
- DMR native reranking is fastest but doesn't support custom criteria
- Criteria works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini (chat-based reranking using structured-outputs)
- Fallback: If reranking fails, original post-fusion retrieval scores are used

### RAG Configuration Reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `docs` | []string | Document paths/directories (shared across strategies) |
| `description` | string | Human-readable description |
| `respect_vcs` | boolean | Whether to respect VCS ignore files like .gitignore (default: `true`) |
| `strategies` | []object | Array of strategy configurations |
| `results` | object | Post-processing configuration |

**Strategy Configuration:**
- `type`: Strategy type (`chunked-embeddings`, `semantic-embeddings`, `bm25`)
- `docs`: Strategy-specific documents (optional, augments shared docs)
- `database`: Database configuration (path to local sqlite db)
- `chunking`: Chunking configuration
- `limit`: Max results from this strategy (for fusion)
- `respect_vcs`: Override RAG-level VCS ignore setting for this strategy only (optional)

**Chunked-Embeddings Strategy Parameters:**
- `model` (required): Embedding model reference
- `database`: Database configuration  
  - simple string path to local sqlite db (e.g. `./vector.db`)
- `similarity_metric`: Similarity metric (only `cosine_similarity` now, `euclidean_distance`, `dot_product`, etc to come in the future)
- `threshold`: Minimum similarity (0–1, default: `0.5`)
- `limit`: Max candidates from this strategy for fusion input (default: `5`)
- `batch_size`: Number of chunks per embedding request (default: `50`)
- `max_embedding_concurrency`: Maximum concurrent embedding batch requests (default: `3`)
- `chunking.size`: Chunk size in characters (default: `1000`)
- `chunking.overlap`: Overlap between chunks (default: `75`)

**Semantic-Embeddings Strategy:**
- `embedding_model` (required): Embedding model reference (e.g., `openai/text-embedding-3-small`)
- `chat_model` (required): Chat model for generating semantic summaries (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`)
- `vector_dimensions` (required): Embedding vector dimensions (e.g., `1536` for text-embedding-3-small)
- `database`: Database configuration (same formats as chunked-embeddings)
- `semantic_prompt`: Custom prompt template using JS template literals (`${path}`, `${basename}`, `${chunk_index}`, `${content}`, `${ast_context}`)
- `ast_context`: Include TreeSitter AST metadata in semantic prompts. Useful for code (default: `false`, best with `code_aware` chunking)
- `similarity_metric`: Similarity metric (default: `cosine_similarity`)
- `threshold`: Minimum similarity (0–1, default: `0.5`)
- `limit`: Max candidates from this strategy for fusion input (default: `5`)
- `embedding_batch_size`: Chunks per embedding request (default: `50`)
- `max_embedding_concurrency`: Concurrent embedding/LLM requests (default: `3`)
- `max_indexing_concurrency`: Concurrent file indexing (default: `3`)
- `chunking.size`: Chunk size in characters (default: `1000`)
- `chunking.overlap`: Overlap between chunks (default: `75`)
- `chunking.code_aware`: Use AST-based chunking (default: `false`, if `true` the `chunking.overlap` will be ignored)

**BM25 Strategy:**
- `database`: Database configuration (same formats as chunked-embeddings)
- `k1`: Term frequency saturation (recommended range: `1.2–2.0`, default: `1.5`)
- `b`: Length normalization (`0–1`, default: `0.75`)
- `threshold`: Minimum BM25 score (default: `0.0`)
- `limit`: Max candidates from this strategy for fusion input (default: `5`)
- `chunking.size`: Chunk size in characters (default: `1000`)
- `chunking.overlap`: Overlap between chunks (default: `75`)

**Code-Aware Chunking:**

When indexing source code, you can enable code-aware chunking to produce semantically aligned chunks based on the code's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). This keeps functions and methods intact rather than splitting them arbitrarily:

```yaml
rag:
  codebase:
    docs: [./src]
    strategies:
      - type: bm25
        database: ./code.db
        chunking:
          size: 2000
          code_aware: true  # Enable AST-based chunking
```

- `chunking.code_aware`: When `true`, uses tree-sitter for AST-based chunking (default: `false`), and `size` becomes indicative

**Notes:**
- Currently supports **Go** source files (`.go`). More languages will be added incrementally.
- Falls back to plain text chunking for unsupported file types.
- Produces chunks that align with code structure (functions, methods, type declarations).
- Particularly useful for code search and retrieval tasks.

**Results:**
- `limit`: Final number of results (default: `15`)
- `deduplicate`: Remove duplicates (default: `true`)
- `fusion.strategy`: rrf, weighted, or max
- `fusion.k`: RRF parameter
- `fusion.weights`: Weights for weighted fusion
- `reranking`: Optional reranking configuration (see [Result Reranking](#result-reranking) section)
  - `reranking.model`: Model reference for reranking
  - `reranking.top_k`: Only rerank top K results (default: `0` = rerank all)
  - `reranking.threshold`: Minimum score after reranking (default: `0.0`)
  - `reranking.criteria`: Domain-specific relevance guidance (optional, not supported by DMR native)
- `return_full_content`: When `true`, return full document contents instead of just matched chunks (default: `false`)

### Debugging RAG

Enable debug logging to see detailed retrieval and fusion information:

```bash
./bin/cagent run config.yaml --debug --log-file cagent.debug
```

Look for logs tagged with:
- `[RAG Manager]` - Overall operations
- `[Chunked-Embeddings Strategy]` - Chunked-embeddings retrieval
- `[BM25 Strategy]` - BM25 retrieval
- `[RRF Fusion]` / `[Weighted Fusion]` / `[Max Fusion]` - Result fusion
- `[Reranker]` - Reranking operations and score adjustments

### RAG Examples

See `examples/rag/` directory:
- `examples/rag/bm25.yaml` - BM25 strategy only
- `examples/rag/hybrid.yaml` - Hybrid retrieval (chunked-embeddings + BM25)
- `examples/rag/semantic_embeddings.yaml` - Semantic-embeddings strategy with LLM summaries

## Advanced Features

### Agent Store and Distribution

cagent supports distributing via, and running agents from, Docker registries:

```bash
# Pull an agent from a registry
./bin/cagent pull docker.io/username/my-agent:latest

# Push your agent to a registry
./bin/cagent push docker.io/username/my-agent:latest

# Run an agent directly from an image reference
./bin/cagent run docker.io/username/my-agent:latest
```

**Agent References:**

- File agents: `my-agent.yaml` (relative path)
- Store agents: `docker.io/username/my-agent:latest` (full Docker reference)
