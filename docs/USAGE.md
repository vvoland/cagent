# Usage and configuration

This guide will help you get started with cagent and learn how to use its
powerful multi-agent system to accomplish various tasks.

## What is cagent?

cagent is a powerful, customizable multi-agent system that orchestrates AI
agents with specialized capabilities and tools. It features:

- **🏗️ Multi-tenant architecture** with client isolation and session management
- **🔧 Rich tool ecosystem** via Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration
- **🤖 Hierarchical agent system** with intelligent task delegation
- **🌐 Multiple interfaces** including CLI, TUI, API server, and MCP server
- **📦 Agent distribution** via Docker registry integration
- **🔒 Security-first design** with proper client scoping and resource isolation
- **⚡ Event-driven streaming** for real-time interactions
- **🧠 Multi-model support** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, [Docker Model Runner (DMR)](https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/))


## Why?

After passing the last year+ building AI agents of various types, using a variety of software solutions and frameworks, we kept asking ourselves some of the same questions:

- How can we make building and running useful agentic systems less of a hassle?
- Most agents we build end up use many of the same building blocks. Can we re-use most of those building block and have declarative configurations for new agents?
- How can we package and share agents amongst each other as simply as possible without all the headaches?

We really think we're getting somewhere as we build out the primitives of `cagent` so, in keeping with our love for open-source software in general, we decided to **share it and build it in the open** to allow the community at large to make use of our work and contribute to the future of the project itself. 

## Running Agents

### Command Line Interface

cagent provides multiple interfaces and deployment modes:

```bash
# Interactive CLI mode
$ ./bin/cagent run config.yaml
$ ./bin/cagent run config.yaml -a agent_name  # Run specific agent
$ ./bin/cagent run config.yaml --debug        # Enable debug logging

# Terminal UI
$ ./bin/cagent tui config.yaml

# MCP Server Mode (for external clients like Claude Code)
$ ./bin/cagent mcp server --agents-dir ./config_directory
$ ./bin/cagent mcp server --port 8080 --path /mcp --agents-dir ./config

# API Server (HTTP REST API)
$ ./bin/cagent api config.yaml
$ ./bin/cagent api config.yaml --port 8080

# Project Management
$ ./bin/cagent new                          # Initialize new project
$ ./bin/cagent eval config.yaml             # Run evaluations
$ ./bin/cagent pull docker.io/user/agent    # Pull agent from registry
$ ./bin/cagent push docker.io/user/agent    # Push agent to registry
```

### Interface-Specific Features

#### CLI Interactive Commands

During CLI sessions, you can use special commands:

| Command    | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `/exit`    | Exit the program                            |
| `/reset`   | Clear conversation history                  |
| `/eval`    | Save current conversation for evaluation    |
| `/compact` | Compact conversation to lower context usage |

#### MCP Server Mode

- **External client integration**: Works with Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP clients
- **Session isolation**: Each MCP client gets isolated sessions
- **Tool exposure**: Agents accessible as MCP tools for external use
- **Real-time streaming**: SSE-based streaming responses
- **Multi-client support**: Handle multiple concurrent MCP clients

### Alloy models

"Alloy models" essentially means using more than one model in the same chat context. Not at the same time, but "randomly" throughout the conversation to try to take advantage of the strong points of each model.

More information on the idea can be found [here](https://xbow.com/blog/alloy-agents)

To have an agent use an alloy model, you can define more than one model in the `model` field, separated by commas.

Example:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0,openai/gpt-5-mini
    ...
```

### Tool Configuration


### Available MCP Tools

Common MCP tools include:

- **Filesystem**: Read/write files
- **Shell**: Execute shell commands
- **Database**: Query databases
- **Web**: Make HTTP requests
- **Git**: Version control operations
- **Browser**: Web browsing and automation
- **Code**: Programming language specific tools
- **API**: REST API integration tools

### Installing MCP Tools

Example installation of local tools:

```bash
# Install Rust-based MCP filesystem tool
cargo install rust-mcp-filesystem

# Install other popular MCP tools
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-git
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-web
```

### Configuring MCP Tools

**Local (stdio) MCP Server:**

```yaml

toolsets:
  - type: mcp # Model Context Protocol
    command: string # Command to execute
    args: [] # Command arguments
    tools: [] # Optional: List of specific tools to enable
    env: [] # Environment variables for this tool
    env_file: [] # Environment variable files
```

Example:

``` yaml
toolsets:
  - type: mcp
    command: rust-mcp-filesystem
    args: ["--allow-write", "."]
    tools: ["read_file", "write_file"] # Optional: specific tools only
    env:
      - "RUST_LOG=debug"
```

**Remote (SSE) MCP Server:**

```yaml
toolsets:
  - type: mcp # Model Context Protocol
    remote:
      url: string # Base URL to connect to
      transport_type: string # Type of MCP transport (sse or streamable)
      headers:
        key: value # HTTP headers. Mainly used for auth
    tools: [] # Optional: List of specific tools to enable
```

Example:

```yaml
toolsets:
  - type: mcp
    remote:
      url: "https://mcp-server.example.com"
      transport_type: "sse"
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer your-token-here"
    tools: ["search_web", "fetch_url"]
```

## Built-in Tools

Included in `cagent` are a series of built-in tools that can greatly enhance the capabilities of your agents without needing to configure any external MCP tools.  

**Configuration example**

```yaml
toolsets:
  - type: filesystem # Grants the agent filesystem access
  - type: think # Enables the think tool
  - type: todo # Enable the todo list tool
    shared: boolean # Should the todo list be shared between agents (optional)
  - type: memory # Allows the agent to store memories to a local sqlite db
    path: ./mem.db # Path to the sqlite database for memory storage (optional)
```

Let's go into a bit more detail about the built-in tools that agents can use:

### Think Tool

The think tool allows agents to reason through problems step by step:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    # ... other config
    toolsets:
      - type: think
```

### Todo Tool

The todo tool helps agents manage task lists:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    # ... other config
    toolsets:
      - type: todo
```

### Memory Tool

The memory tool provides persistent storage:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    # ... other config
    toolsets:
      - type: memory
        path: "./agent_memory.db"
```

### Task Transfer Tool

All agents automatically have access to the task transfer tool, which allows
them to delegate tasks to other agents:

```
transfer_task(agent="developer", task="Create a login form", expected_output="HTML and CSS code")
```

### Using tools via the Docker MCP Gateway

We recommend using MCP tools via the [Docker MCP Gateway](https://github.com/docker/mcp-gateway).  
All tools are containerized for resource isolation and security, and all the tools in the catalog can be accessed through a single endpoint

Using the `docker mcp gateway` command you can configure your agents with a set of MCP tools
delivered straight from Docker's MCP Gateway.

> you can check `docker mcp gateway run --help` for more information on how to use that command

In this example, lets configure duckduckgo to give our agents the ability to search the web:

```yaml
toolsets:
  - type: mcp
    command: docker
    args: ["mcp", "gateway", "run", "--servers=duckduckgo"]
```


## Examples

### Development Team

A complete development team with specialized roles:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    model: claude
    description: Technical lead coordinating development
    instruction: |
      You are a technical lead managing a development team.
      Coordinate tasks between developers and ensure quality.
    sub_agents: [developer, reviewer, tester]

      analyze data, and provide insights.
    toolsets:
      - type: mcp
        command: mcp-web-search
        args: ["--provider", "duckduckgo"]
      - type: todo

    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-0
    max_tokens: 64000
```

## Advanced Features

### Agent Store and Distribution

cagent supports distributing via, and running agents from, Docker registries:

```bash
# Pull an agent from a registry
./bin/cagent pull docker.io/username/my-agent:latest

# Push your agent to a registry
./bin/cagent push docker.io/username/my-agent:latest

# Run an agent directly from an image reference
./bin/cagent run docker.io/username/my-agent:latest
```

**Agent References:**

- File agents: `my-agent.yaml` (relative path)
- Store agents: `docker.io/username/my-agent:latest` (full Docker reference)


### Session Management

**MCP Server Sessions:**

- Client-isolated sessions
- Session creation and management via MCP tools
- Real-time streaming responses
- Session timeout and cleanup

## Best Practices

### Agent Design

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should have a clear, focused purpose
2. **Clear Instructions**: Provide detailed, specific instructions for each agent
3. **Appropriate Tools**: Give agents only the tools they need
4. **Hierarchy Design**: Use sub-agents for specialized tasks and clear delegation paths
5. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models for different capabilities (reasoning vs creativity)

### Configuration Management

1. **Validation**: Always validate your configuration before running
2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
3. **Modularity**: Break complex configurations into smaller, reusable pieces
4. **Documentation**: Document your agent configurations and tool permissions
5. **Version Control**: Track agent configurations in git for reproducibility

### Tool Usage

1. **Minimal Permissions**: Give tools only necessary permissions
2. **Error Handling**: Consider how agents will handle tool failures
3. **Security**: Be cautious with shell access and file system permissions
4. **Testing**: Test tool combinations thoroughly in isolation
5. **MCP Tool Lifecycle**: Properly handle MCP tool start/stop lifecycle

### Production Deployment

1. **MCP Server Mode**: Use MCP server for external integrations
2. **Session Limits**: Configure appropriate session limits and timeouts
3. **Monitoring**: Enable debug logging for troubleshooting
4. **Resource Management**: Monitor memory and CPU usage for concurrent sessions
5. **Client Isolation**: Ensure proper client scoping in multi-tenant deployments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent not responding:**

- Check API keys are set correctly
- Verify model name matches provider
- Check network connectivity

**Tool errors:**

- Ensure MCP tools are installed and accessible
- Check file permissions for filesystem tools
- Verify tool arguments and command paths
- Test MCP tools independently before integration
- Check tool lifecycle (start/stop) in debug logs

**Configuration errors:**

- Validate YAML syntax
- Check all referenced agents exist
- Ensure all models are defined
- Verify toolset configurations
- Check agent hierarchy (sub_agents references)

**Session and connectivity issues:**

- Verify port availability for MCP server modes
- Test MCP endpoint accessibility (curl test)
- Verify client isolation in multi-tenant scenarios
- Check session timeouts and limits

**Performance issues:**

- Monitor memory usage with multiple concurrent sessions
- Check for tool resource leaks
- Verify proper session cleanup
- Monitor streaming response performance

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for detailed information:

```bash
# CLI mode
./bin/cagent run config.yaml --debug

# MCP server
./bin/cagent mcp server --agents-dir ./config --debug
```

### Log Analysis

Check logs for:

- API call errors and rate limiting
- Tool execution failures and timeouts
- Configuration validation issues
- Network connectivity problems
- MCP protocol handshake issues
- Session creation and cleanup events
- Client isolation boundary violations

### Testing MCP Integration

Test MCP server functionality:

```bash
# Start MCP server
./bin/cagent mcp server --agents-dir ./examples/config --port 8080 --debug

# Test with curl (check server is running)
curl -N http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse

# Run MCP test client
cd examples/mcptesting
go run test-mcp-client.go
```

### Agent Store Issues

```bash
# Check agent resolution
./bin/cagent mcp server --agents-dir ./config --debug
# Look for "Agent resolved" messages in logs

# Test Docker registry connectivity
docker pull docker.io/username/agent:latest

# Verify agent content
./bin/cagent pull docker.io/username/agent:latest
```

## Integration Examples

### MCP Client Integration

Using cagent agents from external MCP clients:

```javascript
// Example: Using cagent from Claude Code or Cursor
const mcp = require("@modelcontextprotocol/client");

// Connect to cagent MCP server
const client = new mcp.Client({
  url: "http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse",
  transport: "sse",
});

// List available agents
const agents = await client.callTool("list_agents", {});

// Create a session with a specific agent
const session = await client.callTool("create_agent_session", {
  agent_spec: "developer",
  initial_message: "Help me debug this Python code",
});

// Send messages to the agent
const response = await client.callTool("send_message", {
  session_id: session.session_id,
  message:
    "def fibonacci(n): return n if n <= 1 else fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)",
});
```

### Custom Memory Strategies

Implement persistent memory across sessions:

```yaml
agents:
  researcher:
    model: claude
    memory:
      path: "./research_memory.db"
    instruction: |
      You are a research assistant with persistent memory.
      Remember important findings and reference previous research.
```

### Multi-Model Teams

```yaml
models:
  # Local model for fast responses
  claude_local:
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-0
    temperature: 0.2

  gpt4:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o
    temperature: 0.1

  # Creative model for content generation
  gpt4_creative:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o
    temperature: 0.8

agents:
  analyst:
    model: claude_local
    description: Fast analysis and reasoning

  coder:
    model: gpt4
    description: not very creative developer

  writer:
    model: gpt4_creative
    description: Creative content generation
```
