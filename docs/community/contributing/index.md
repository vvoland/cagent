# Contributing

_docker-agent is open source. Here's how to set up your development environment and contribute._

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.25](https://go.dev/dl/) or higher
- API key(s) for your chosen AI provider
- [Task 3.44](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) or higher
- [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/docs/welcome/install/#binaries)

<div class="callout callout-info">
<div class="callout-title">ℹ️ Platform Support
</div>
  <p>macOS and Linux are fully supported for development. On Windows, use <code>task build-local</code> to build via Docker.</p>

</div>

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/docker/cagent.git
cd cagent
task build

# Set API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Run an example
./bin/docker-agent run examples/code.yaml
```

### Development Commands

| Command            | Description                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `task build`       | Build the binary to `./bin/docker-agent`        |
| `task test`        | Run all tests (clears API keys for determinism) |
| `task lint`        | Run golangci-lint                               |
| `task format`      | Format code                                     |
| `task dev`         | Run lint, test, and build in sequence           |
| `task build-local` | Build for local platform via Docker             |
| `task cross`       | Cross-platform builds (all architectures)       |

## Dogfooding

Use docker-agent to work on docker-agent! The project includes a specialized developer agent:

```bash
cd cagent
docker agent run ./golang_developer.yaml
```

This agent is an expert Go developer that understands the docker-agent codebase. Ask it questions, request fixes, or have it implement features.

## Core Concepts

- **Root Agent** — Main entry point that coordinates the system
- **Sub-Agents** — Specialized agents for specific domains
- **Tools** — External capabilities via MCP
- **Models** — AI provider configurations

## Code Style

The project uses `golangci-lint` with strict rules. As long as `task lint` passes, the code is stylistically acceptable.

Key conventions:

- Use `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` for error wrapping
- Always pass `context.Context` as the first parameter
- Use `slog` for structured logging
- Use functional options pattern for constructors
- In tests: use `t.Context()`, `t.TempDir()`, `t.Setenv()`, and `t.Parallel()`

## Opening Issues

File issues on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/docker/cagent/issues). Please:

<div class="callout callout-info">

- Use the included issue template
- Search for existing issues before creating new ones
- Only use issues for bugs and feature requests (not support)

## Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch for your changes
2. **Write** your code following the style and testing guidelines above
3. **Test** your changes: run `task lint` and `task test`
4. **Sign** your commits with `git commit -s` (DCO required)
5. **Open a pull request** against the `main` branch

## Sign Your Work

All contributions require a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign-off:

```bash
# Sign commits automatically
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```
