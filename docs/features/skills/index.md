# Skills

_Skills provide specialized instructions that agents can load on demand when a task matches a skill's description._

## How Skills Work

1. docker-agent scans standard directories for `SKILL.md` files
2. Skill metadata (name, description) is injected into the agent's system prompt
3. When a user request matches a skill, the agent reads the full instructions
4. The agent follows the skill's detailed instructions to complete the task

## Enabling Skills

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: You are a helpful assistant.
    skills: true
    toolsets:
      - type: filesystem # required for reading skill files
```

## SKILL.md Format

<!-- yaml-lint:skip -->
```yaml
---
name: create-dockerfile
description: Create optimized Dockerfiles for applications
license: Apache-2.0
metadata:
  author: my-org
  version: "1.0"
---

# Creating Dockerfiles

When asked to create a Dockerfile:

1. Analyze the application type and language
2. Use multi-stage builds for compiled languages
3. Minimize image size by using slim base images
4. Follow security best practices (non-root user, etc.)
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field            | Required | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`           | Yes      | Unique skill identifier                                                     |
| `description`    | Yes      | Short description shown to the agent for skill matching                     |
| `context`        | No       | Set to `fork` to run the skill as an isolated sub-agent (see below)         |
| `allowed-tools`  | No       | List of tools the skill needs (YAML list or comma-separated string)         |
| `license`        | No       | License identifier (e.g. `Apache-2.0`)                                      |
| `compatibility`  | No       | Free-text compatibility notes                                               |
| `metadata`       | No       | Arbitrary key-value pairs (e.g. `author`, `version`)                        |

## Running a Skill as a Sub-Agent

By default, when an agent invokes a skill it reads the instructions inline into its own conversation. For complex, multi-step skills this can consume a large portion of the agent's context window and pollute the parent conversation with intermediate tool calls.

Adding `context: fork` to the SKILL.md frontmatter tells the agent to run the skill in an **isolated sub-agent** instead:

<!-- yaml-lint:skip -->
```yaml
---
name: bump-go-dependencies
description: Update Go module dependencies one by one
context: fork
---

# Bump Dependencies

1. List outdated deps
2. Update each one, run tests, commit or revert
3. Produce a summary table
```

When the agent encounters a task that matches a `context: fork` skill, it uses the `run_skill` tool instead of `read_skill`. This:

- **Spawns a child session** with the skill content as the system prompt and the caller's task as the user message
- **Isolates the context window** — the sub-agent has its own conversation history, so lengthy tool-call chains don't eat into the parent's token budget
- **Folds the result** — only the sub-agent's final answer is returned to the parent as the tool result
- **Inherits the parent's model and tools** — the sub-agent can use all tools available to the parent agent

<div class="callout callout-tip" markdown="1">
<div class="callout-title">💡 When to use context: fork
</div>
  <p>Use <code>context: fork</code> for skills that involve many steps, heavy tool usage, or that should not clutter the main conversation — for example dependency bumping, large refactors, or code generation pipelines.</p>

## Search Paths

Skills are discovered from these locations (later overrides earlier):

### Global

| Path                | Search Type                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `~/.codex/skills/`  | Recursive (searches all subdirectories) |
| `~/.claude/skills/` | Flat (immediate children only)          |
| `~/.agents/skills/` | Recursive (searches all subdirectories) |

### Project (from git root to current directory)

| Path              | Search Type                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `.claude/skills/` | Flat (cwd only)                            |
| `.agents/skills/` | Flat (each directory from git root to cwd) |

## Invoking Skills

Skills can be invoked in multiple ways:

- **Automatic:** The agent detects when your request matches a skill's description and loads it automatically
- **Explicit:** Reference the skill name in your prompt: "Use the create-dockerfile skill to..."
- **Slash command:** Use `/{skill-name}` to invoke a skill directly

```bash
# In the TUI, invoke skill directly:
/create-dockerfile

# Or mention it in your message:
"Create a dockerfile for my Python app (use the create-dockerfile skill)"
```

## Precedence

When multiple skills share the same name:

1. Global skills load first
2. Project skills load next, from git root toward current directory
3. Skills closer to the current directory override those further away

## Creating a Skill

```bash
# Create the skill directory
$ mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills/create-dockerfile

# Write the SKILL.md file
$ cat > ~/.agents/skills/create-dockerfile/SKILL.md << 'EOF'

name: create-dockerfile

# Creating Dockerfiles

When asked to create a Dockerfile:

1. Analyze the application type and language
2. Use multi-stage builds for compiled languages
3. Use slim base images to minimize size
4. Run as non-root user for security
EOF
```

The skill will automatically be available to any agent with `skills: true`.
