<h1>Multi-Agent Systems</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Build teams of specialized agents that collaborate and delegate tasks to each other.</p>

<h2>Why Multi-Agent?</h2>

<p>Complex tasks benefit from specialization. Instead of one monolithic agent trying to do everything, you can create a <strong>team</strong> of focused agents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>coordinator</strong> that understands the overall goal and delegates</li>
  <li>A <strong>developer</strong> that writes code with filesystem and shell access</li>
  <li>A <strong>reviewer</strong> that checks code quality</li>
  <li>A <strong>researcher</strong> that searches the web for information</li>
</ul>

<p>Each agent has its own model, tools, and instructions — optimized for its specific role.</p>

<h2>How Delegation Works</h2>

<p>Agents delegate tasks using the built-in <code>transfer_task</code> tool, which is automatically available to any agent with sub-agents. This smart delegation means agents can automatically route tasks to the most suitable specialist.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>User</strong> sends a message to the root agent</li>
  <li><strong>Root agent</strong> analyzes the request and decides which sub-agent should handle it</li>
  <li><strong>Root agent</strong> calls <code>transfer_task</code> with the target agent, task description, and expected output</li>
  <li><strong>Sub-agent</strong> processes the task in its own agentic loop using its tools</li>
  <li><strong>Results</strong> flow back to the root agent, which responds to the user</li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># The transfer_task tool call looks like:
transfer_task(
  agent="developer",
  task="Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication",
  expected_output="Working Go code with tests"
)</code></pre>

<div class="callout callout-info">
  <div class="callout-title">ℹ️ Auto-Approved</div>
  <p>Unlike other tools, <code>transfer_task</code> is always auto-approved — no user confirmation needed. This allows seamless delegation between agents.</p>

<h2>Example: Development Team</h2>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">agents:
  root:
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0
    description: Technical lead coordinating development
    instruction: |
      You are a technical lead managing a development team.
      Analyze requests and delegate to the right specialist.
      Ensure quality by reviewing results before responding.
    sub_agents: [developer, reviewer, tester]
    toolsets:
      - type: think

  developer:
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0
    description: Expert software developer
    instruction: |
      You are an expert developer. Write clean, efficient code
      and follow best practices.
    toolsets:
      - type: filesystem
      - type: shell
      - type: think

  reviewer:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    description: Code review specialist
    instruction: |
      You review code for quality, security, and maintainability.
      Provide actionable feedback.
    toolsets:
      - type: filesystem

  tester:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    description: Quality assurance engineer
    instruction: |
      You write tests and ensure software quality. Run tests
      and report results.
    toolsets:
      - type: shell
      - type: todo</code></pre>

<h2>Example: Research Team</h2>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">agents:
  root:
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0
    description: Research coordinator
    instruction: |
      Coordinate research tasks. Delegate web searches to
      the researcher and writing to the writer.
    sub_agents: [researcher, writer]
    toolsets:
      - type: think

  researcher:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    description: Web researcher
    instruction: Search the web and gather information.
    toolsets:
      - type: mcp
        ref: docker:duckduckgo
      - type: memory
        path: ./research.db

  writer:
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0
    description: Content writer
    instruction: Write clear, well-structured content.
    toolsets:
      - type: filesystem</code></pre>

<h2>Multi-Model Teams</h2>

<p>A key advantage of multi-agent systems is using different models for different roles — picking the best model for each job:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">models:
  fast:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-5-mini
    temperature: 0.2      # precise

  creative:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o
    temperature: 0.8      # creative

  local:
    provider: dmr
    model: ai/qwen3       # runs locally, no API cost

agents:
  analyst:
    model: fast           # cheap and fast for analysis
  writer:
    model: creative       # creative for content
  helper:
    model: local          # free for simple tasks</code></pre>

<h2>Shared Tools</h2>

<p>Tools like <code>todo</code> can be shared between agents for collaborative task tracking:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">toolsets:
  - type: todo
    shared: true  # all agents see the same todo list</code></pre>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Keep agents focused</strong> — Each agent should have a clear, narrow role</li>
  <li><strong>Write clear descriptions</strong> — The coordinator uses descriptions to decide who to delegate to</li>
  <li><strong>Give minimal tools</strong> — Only give each agent the tools it needs for its specific role</li>
  <li><strong>Use the think tool</strong> — Give coordinators the think tool so they reason about delegation</li>
  <li><strong>Use the right model</strong> — Use capable models for complex reasoning, cheap models for simple tasks</li>
</ul>
