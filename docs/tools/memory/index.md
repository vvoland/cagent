# Memory Tool

_Persistent key-value storage backed by SQLite for cross-session recall._

## Overview

The memory tool provides persistent key-value storage backed by SQLite. Data survives across sessions, allowing agents to remember facts, user preferences, project context, and past decisions. Memories can be organized with categories and searched by keyword.

Each agent gets its own database at `~/.cagent/memory/<agent-name>/memory.db` by default.

## Available Tools

| Tool              | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `add_memory`      | Store a new memory with optional category                                        |
| `get_memories`    | Retrieve all stored memories                                                     |
| `delete_memory`   | Delete a specific memory by ID                                                   |
| `search_memories` | Search memories by keywords and/or category (more efficient than `get_memories`) |
| `update_memory`   | Update an existing memory's content and/or category by ID                        |

## Configuration

```yaml
toolsets:
  - type: memory
```

### Options

| Property | Type   | Default                                   | Description                      |
| -------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `path`   | string | `~/.cagent/memory/<agent-name>/memory.db` | Path to the SQLite database file |

### Custom Database Path

```yaml
toolsets:
  - type: memory
    path: ./agent_memory.db
```

## Categories

Memories support an optional `category` field for organization and filtering. Common categories include:

- `preference` — User preferences and settings
- `fact` — Factual information about the project or user
- `project` — Project-specific context
- `decision` — Past decisions and their rationale

  <p>Memory is especially useful for long-running assistants that need to recall information across conversations — like coding preferences, project conventions, or context discovered during previous sessions.</p>
