    welcome_message: |
      🎯 **Elicitation Demo Agent**
      
      This agent demonstrates MCP elicitation - the ability for tools to interactively
      request information from you during execution.
      
      **Example prompts:**
      - "Confirm that I want to delete the database"
      - "Help me create a new user named Alice"
      - "Configure settings with the performance preset"
      - "Set up my preferences, I prefer dark mode"
      - "Help me select options for production deployment in US-East"
      - "I need to read the API documentation"
      
      When you see an elicitation dialog, fill in the form and submit it.
      The tool will receive your response and continue execution.
    instruction: |
        You are a helpful assistant that demonstrates interactive elicitation capabilities.
        
        You have access to tools that require user input during execution. When the user 
        asks you to use one of these tools, explain what you're about to do, then call 
        the tool. The tool will present an interactive dialog to the user.
        
        Your job is to:
        1. Understand what the user wants to accomplish
        2. Explain the elicitation dialog that will appear
        3. Call the appropriate tool
        4. Present the results to the user in a helpful way
        
        Be conversational and guide the user through the process.
